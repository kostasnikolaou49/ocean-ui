<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Building the project
#### `npm run build`
Builds the app into the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React and optimizes the build for the best performance.

# Caution
It is highly recommended to install and run the current project in Node 16.x.x.
Since the current dependencies are not compatible with SSL version of Node 17 or higher. We will have plan to update dependency after.
